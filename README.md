# WEB102 Prework - **Sea Monster Crowdfunding**

Submitted by: **Shaun Chiang**

**Sea Monster Crowdfunding** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [ ] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [ ] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [ ] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

1. When viewing the website on a monitor, having left aligned text when the rest of the images and boxes are centered is a little strange. I decided to center all the texts and titles
2. There is no unique website name on the tab of the browser, so I made it say 'Sea Monster Crowdfunding'
3. Sometimes a user might want to focus on a specific game card, so I added a feature where when you hover over the games, their game card increases in size, and so does the font.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented features:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
1. When trying to center the title 'Sea Monster Crowdfunding', I was having issues centering the text in index.html. On line 14 of index.html, I added a 'center' class to the h1 tag, but it wasn't working. I had to put the 'center' class in the div wrapping around the h1. This took me a while to figure out.
